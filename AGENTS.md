# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

# ReactFlow — don't trust training data

This project uses ReactFlow (React Flow / `@xyflow/react`) for the canvas. Its
APIs, components, hooks, and props change across versions and may differ from
your training data. Before writing or changing any ReactFlow code, fetch and
consult the official LLM docs index at https://reactflow.dev/llms.txt and follow
the linked pages relevant to what you're building. Do not rely on memory for
component names, props, hook signatures, or usage patterns.

# JSX text escaping

Escape apostrophes and quotes in JSX text content — raw `'` and `"` trip the
`react/no-unescaped-entities` lint rule. Use `&apos;` for apostrophes and
`&quot;` for quotes (e.g. `you&apos;re`, `doesn&apos;t`). This applies only to
literal text between JSX tags, not to string attribute values or JS strings.

# Database types

Derive database types from the Drizzle schema — never hand-write custom or partial
shapes for table rows. Export `typeof table.$inferSelect` (and `$inferInsert` when
needed) from `lib/schema.ts` and import it. When a consumer needs only some
columns, narrow with `Pick<Row, ...>` / `Omit<Row, ...>` rather than redeclaring a
literal type. Don't add an insert type where `db.insert(...).values()` already
enforces the shape.

<!-- TRIGGER.DEV SKILLS START -->

## Trigger.dev agent skills

This project has Trigger.dev agent skills installed in `.agents/skills/`. Before writing or changing Trigger.dev code (background tasks, scheduled tasks, realtime, or chat.agent AI agents), load the most relevant skill: `trigger-authoring-chat-agent`, `trigger-authoring-tasks`, `trigger-chat-agent-advanced`, `trigger-cost-savings`, `trigger-getting-started`, `trigger-realtime-and-frontend`.
